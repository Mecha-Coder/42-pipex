### **Overview**

An introduction to pipes (|) and how commands are executed inside a shell.

---

### **Key Learnings**
- Understand file descriptors and how to redirect the flow of data using them
- Learn how pipes enable communication between multiple programs
- Understand how  shell executes commands and child process

---

### **About**

ðŸ‘‰ [**Project requirement**](https://github.com/Mecha-Coder/42-pipex/blob/main/demo/en.subject.pdf)

This project serves as a foundation for the later Minishell project.
Pipes are what enable a shell to chain multiple commands, passing the output of one command as the input of the next. Each command in a shell is simply a program.

The core system calls that make piping possible are:
- `pipe()` â€” creates a communication channel between programs
- `fork()` â€” spawns a new child process
- `execve()` â€” replaces the child process with a new program
- `dup2()` â€” redirects input and output streams of a program

Since this project focuses on the execution side, the input command structure is simplified.
